## Abstract

This repository contains the research work for a study that investigates the clustering of political, executive, legislative, and judicial corruption in 133 countries from 2000 to 2022, using time-series clustering techniques. The clustering was achieved through methods such as Time Series K-means with different distance metrics (Euclidean, DTW, Soft-DTW) and Kernel K-means. Model evaluations were conducted using the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Score. In addition, the study explores the correlation between the absence of corruption in these clusters and key socio-political and economic variables.


### Methodology
Describes the data collection process, the clustering techniques used, such as Time Series K-means with different distance metrics and Kernel K-means, and the model evaluation methods.

### Results and Discussion
Interprets the results, explores the relationship between governance, economic variables, and corruption, and discusses the correlations found in single-country clusters.
